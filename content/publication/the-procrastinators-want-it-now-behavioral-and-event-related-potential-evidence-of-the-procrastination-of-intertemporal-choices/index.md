abstract: Much past research has focused on the correlation between
  procrastination and personality traits (e.g.,impulsivity). According to the
  temporal motivation theory, procrastinators are impulsive and sensitive to
  delays in time. However, there is still a lack of direct evidence of the
  tendency of procrastinators to prefer immediate over future rewards. To
  investigate this question, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in the
  brain while participants performed an intertemporal choice task involving both
  time delay and reward processing. The participants were assigned to a high
  procrastination group and a low procrastination group according to their
  scores on self-report measures. We found that high procrastination
  participants preferred immediate rewards compared to future ones whereas low
  procrastination participants did not. High procrastinators also exhibited a
  larger and delayed P2 component, indicating delay time processing and abnormal
  reward processing. No signiﬁcant effect associated with procrastination was
  found on the P300 component. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that high
  procrastinators are more impulsive and encode the information of delay time
  more slowly but with a higher level of motivation-driven attention. The
  current study substantiates higher impulsivity in procrastination and veriﬁes
  that a difference exists in the sensitivity to time delay between high and low
  procrastinators.
