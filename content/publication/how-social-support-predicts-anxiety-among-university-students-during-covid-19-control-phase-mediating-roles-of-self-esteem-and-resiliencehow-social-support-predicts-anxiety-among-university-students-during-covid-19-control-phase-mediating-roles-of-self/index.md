abstract: Public health emergency, such as COVID-19 pandemic, generally has
  severe impacts on mental health in public. One of the often-neglected negative
  consequences is that the control and prevention measures of COVID-19 in the
  post-epidemic can pose psychological threats to public mental health. This
  study aimed to seek the factors and mechanisms to alleviate this mental health
  threat based on a sample of university students in China. Accordingly, this
  study proposed an environmental-individual interaction model examining the
  multiple mediating effects of self-esteem and resilience in the association
  between social support and anxiety among university students during COVID-19
  control phase. A questionnaire containing multiple scales were administered on
  the sample of 2734 Chinese university students. Results indicated that social
  support negatively predicted anxiety through the serial mediating effects of
  self-esteem and resilience sequentially. Our results highlight the impact of
  social support and the internal factors on relieving anxiety among university
  students in COVID-19 control phase. Findings suggest that effective
  psychological intervention tools should be designed and offered to college
  students to reduce anxiety distress and improve mental health in the
  post-epidemic era or the similar situations in the future.
